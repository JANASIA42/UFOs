# UFOs

## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this project is to help Dana construct a site that provides UFO enthusiasts with a comprehensive list of reported sightings across the globe, along with certain data such as the date, location, description, etc.  The data is filterable to allow users to input certain criteria (shape, location, date) to narrow down the data that is displayed based on their interest.

## Results: 
Criteria that users can input to filter the data are highlighted below.  They include date, city, state, country and shape.  Placeholders are used to display the correct formatting for users to input, for instance with the date.  After pressing enter, the filtered data are displayed based on the user's search criteria.

## Summary: 
One draw-back of the site's design is that the data file must be updated separately in order for the content to be current.
Recommendations I would make are:
1. Use web scraping tools to gather the latest data with minimal effort.
2. Add a "key word" filter to capture any other topics of interest that may interest a user (for instance, "red lights" or "hovering").
